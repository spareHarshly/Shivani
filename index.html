          Happiest birthday <span>Shivuu</span>! 🥳 Or should I say… <span>my side chick</span>! 🤡 One of the <span>best people</span> I’ve met online in <span>Super Sus</span>. 🥹 I still remember when I was playing from a <span>friend’s ID</span>, and that’s when I met you. 😂 And you said something like "<span>chup ho ja deep voice bale</span>" 💀 And then you followed my <span>friend’s account</span>. 🙄 That’s when I told you to follow my <span>main account</span>, you did so many <span>drama</span> 😭 And then you said "<span>chal ek sleek racer de phir follow kru gi</span>" 😭 etc etc And after doing all that <span>drama</span>, you said "<span>chal tera sleek racer abhi loan me hai isliye mane follow kr liya</span>" 🤡 Well, thank God you followed, otherwise I don’t even give <span>attention</span> to <span>beggars</span>. 💀 Anyway, from that day, we became <span>friends</span>, 🤝 uhh😩 so many <span>memories</span>,remember?🥹
<br> <br>
The more we talked, the more our <span>friendship</span> grew. 😭 Then we shared <span>Instagram</span>, and you even <span>begged</span> for a follow back— I still remember. 😩 And finally, one day you <span>followed back</span>. 😂  
After that, we started talking <span>daily</span>. 🥲  Whenever I messaged you, you always <span>replied</span>. 🤡 Sometimes I wondered if you were even <span>human</span> or <span>animal</span> who doesn’t sleep at all. 💀 But talking to you was so much <span>fun</span>— <span>Roasting</span>, <span>annoying</span> each other— 😭 And the way you used to <span>irritate</span> me… seriously, no other girl has <span>irritated</span> me like that. 😭 Still, I used to talk and joke with you. 🤝 Our <span>roasting battles</span> were <span>next level</span>, 💀 And they’re still <span>fun</span> even now. 😂  
And sometimes, doing those <span>cringe things</span> with you makes it even more <span>fun</span>. 🥺  Uff, so many <span>memories</span> are coming back right now. 🙃
<br><br>
Well well, whether you agree or not, you’re literally my <span>copy</span>. 🙃 It’s like I found <span>myself</span> in another gender— From <span>family drama</span> to <span>behavior</span>, everything is the same. 😂 Our <span>relatives</span> are "<span>dash dash hai</span>" (gaali nhi duga) 💀 But whatever, what can we do? <span>Life</span> itself is a <span>mess</span>. 😭 Even our way of <span>thinking</span> is the same. 🤡 Only difference is that you’re <span>younger</span> than me—both in <span>age</span> and <span>height</span>. 😂 So you’re my <span>copy</span>, and I’m the <span>original</span>, got it <span>madam</span>? 😎
<br><br>
So <span>happy birthday</span> to the most <span>chill girl</span>! 😩  
Yeah, you should not to be that much <span>chill</span>, but still, it’s fine. 😭 And another thing— you always say "<span>teri list me last me hoti hu haar baar</span>" 😭 So listen— You were <span>last</span> once… but not anymore, okay? 🤝I’ve already <span>proven</span> that to you. 💅 Even though I haven’t heard your <span>live voice</span> till now, I have heard your <span>voice</span>—just not live. 😭  That’s why sometimes I feel like "<span>tu kahi fake toh nhi na</span>" 🤡 But it’s okay. 😩 I just want to say, whatever <span>problems</span> you’ve told me, You can tell me all of that on <span>call</span> too. 📞 Just remember, I’ll always be ready to <span>listen</span> to your <span>endless talks</span>, 😭 And maybe I’ll even <span>overexplain</span> your <span>overthinking</span>, 🙄 But I won’t <span>judge</span> you, okay "<span>Jaaneman</span>" 😭  Because I don’t like when we <span>joke</span> and <span>laugh</span> together, But don’t stand with each other during <span>tough times</span>. 🤝 So always remember this <span>meri maa</span>. 😭
<br><br>
So I won’t take much more time— For now, I’ll just say this: I really wish that our <span>friendship</span> stays <span>forever</span>. 🤞And I’ll never trade this <span>bond</span> for anything. 😤 I’ll always try to keep this <span>connection</span> strong. 🤝 Yeah, I’ll keep <span>annoying</span> you— Maybe sometimes a bit too much— 😂 But please don’t <span>block</span> me! 😭 And I hope one day we <span>meet</span> in real life— Then we’ll see who <span>roasts</span> better face to face 💀 And who’s the best at <span>annoying</span> the other! 🤡 So here’s to <span>fun</span>, <span>weirdness</span>, <span>unforgettable moments</span>, and our <span>friendship</span> — <span>Happy Birthday</span>! 🎉😭
